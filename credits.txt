Technical Enchant +

Originally was made by Hardel and his collaborators. 
Their last version was 4.3.2 of the pack for Minecraft 1.14. 

Now I (Frektip) took the pack to update it for recent Minecraft versions, and making my own 
changes and tweaks. 

Also, IMPORTANT to mention the use of "Splatus" for his custom bow system, "Aeldrion" for her randomizer system, and PauseKawa for his custom GUI detection system
"Blue Commander" (https://www.youtube.com/c/BlueCommander) for the base to create a custom anvil functionality. 
"Stoupy51" for helping me optimizing parts in the code
