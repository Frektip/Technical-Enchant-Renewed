# Technical-Enchant-Renewed
Technical Enchant+ is a Minecraft Datapack that was created originally by Hardel (original link [here](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/enchant-datapack-1-13/)). I updated it adding new features and mechanics for recent Minecraft Versions. 

At its current state, TE+ isn't the same as the original and some of the most important features include:

- 52 new custom enchantments for any gear and item
- 5 new custom curses for any armor, tool or weapon
- Custom enchanting system with Minecraft's vanilla enchanting table
- A Custom Anvil to merge custom enchanted books and items
- Extract custom enchantments from items using the Custom Anvil
- Many customizable options using Admin Commands
- Compatibility with modded items by using "TE+ complements"
- More custom enchantments using "TE+ addons"
- Extra mechanics using "TE+ Extensions" including:
    - Allow mobs to use TE+ enchantments
    - Certain mobs can spawn with TE+ enchanted gear
    - Find custom enchantments in any Minecraft vanilla chest
    - Almost any mob can spawn with custom enchanted books as a drop
    - Exceed the vanilla enchantment level from 20 vanilla enchantments


# Getting started
When you place your first enchanting table you will get an advancement, you should follow the steps that are displayed there. Try getting a guide book (which supports other languages if you have the resource pack installed). You can also check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Frektip/Technical-Enchant-Renewed/wiki) to get more detailed information about the datapack.

# Useful commands

`/function enchantplus:config` To change the TE+ settings (very important for server owners)

`/function enchantplus:give/all` Obtain a barrel with all TE+ items

`/function #enchantplus:uninstall` To uninstall the datapack and its branches (addons, extensions & complements)

`/function enchantplus:heldenchant/set/<enchantment>` While holding an item to enchant it with TE+ enchantments
