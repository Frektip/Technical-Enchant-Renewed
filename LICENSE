WHAT ARE YOU ALLOWED TO DO
###########################

 - You can use any of my projects (datapacks or mods) for any personal reasons.
   This includes looking at the code, modifying it and playing with it in single/multiplayer as long
   as you don't redistribute it without my permission.

 - You are allowed to use any of my projects in a public or private Minecraft server. However,
   it is highly recommended that you give the direct download link from me instead of one hosted by yourself.

 - You are permitted to use any of my projects (without too many modifications) in things like
   datapack collections or modpacks! However, you MUST attribute the creator (me) and add a direct download link.

 - You can also use any of my projects for social media posts i.e a YouTube video
   as a part of a series, showcase, etc. but a download link to it must be provided somewhere 
   explicitly in the main content or at the description. 


###########################
     WHAT YOU CAN'T DO
###########################

 - You are not able to reupload, republish or redistribute any of my projects without my approval;
   it doesn't matter if it is a modified version or not.

 - You're completely denied to use any of the textures from my projects. Most of them were made
   by other people and as such, they are the ones that can use the textures for any purpose
   without any limitations.

 - Even if you modify just one part of the code, you can't upload it as a proper fixed/new version
   of any of Frektip's projects. If you wish to contribute to the code, join the Discord server and let
   me know what changes you're trying to do.

 - In case you want to use a portion of the code from the datapack/mod, you are NOT allowed to use
   it for your personal purposes without the proper credits from it's main source. Even if you made
   drastic changes to the main code, you still need to give a reference of it.
